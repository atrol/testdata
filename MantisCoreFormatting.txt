### Code

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks  ```

Check that the code starts with <?
```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN" "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd" [
<!ENTITY % BOOK_ENTITIES SYSTEM "Admin_Guide.ent">
%BOOK_ENTITIES;
]>
<book>
	<xi:include href="Book_Info.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
	<!-- TODO Add common preface stuff, possibly adapting the default one
        <xi:include href="Preface.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
        -->
	<xi:include href="About.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />

	<xi:include href="Revision_History.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
</book>
```

Check that the code does not contains links for users, issues, notes or e-mail addresses.
Ensure that user administrator, issue 1 and note 1 exist, or change user name, issue id and note id when testing
 
```
@administrator #1 ~1 noreply@mantisbt.org
```

### Tables

Simple Table

```
Col1 | Col2 | Col3
---- | ---- | ----
Row1 | Row1 | Row1
Row2 | Row2 | Row2
```

Col1 | Col2 | Col3
---- | ---- | ----
Row1 | Row1 | Row1
Row2 | Row2 | Row2


Colons can be used to align columns.
```
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
```

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.

> This line is part of the same quote.
